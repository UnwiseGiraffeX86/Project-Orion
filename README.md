# Project Orion ‚Äì RK3566 Development Board

A powerful, compact, and user-friendly development board built from scratch around the **Rockchip RK3566** SoC. Designed for both **hobbyists** and **professionals**, Orion balances performance, connectivity, and expandability while keeping costs accessible. The board runs **Linux (Armbian/Ubuntu/Debian)** and supports a wide ecosystem of peripherals.

**About the creator**  
I am 19 years old and just starting university as an **Electronics Engineering** student. With some prior experience in hobby electronics and PCB design, I‚Äôm using Project Orion to dive deep into **high-speed interfaces (DDR, PCIe, USB 3.0, MIPI)**, **6-layer PCB routing**, **USB-C Power Delivery**, and **Linux bring-up**. This project is both a functional SBC and a learning journey.

## üõ† Project Goals
- Create a **Linux-capable SBC** with modern connectivity in a compact size.
- Offer **plug-and-play usability** for hobbyists while providing **pro-grade interfaces** for industrial/prototyping use.
- Keep **costs as low as possible** without sacrificing usability.
- Provide **full open hardware documentation** (schematics, PCB files, BOM, reference images).
- Showcase a **learning journey** in:
  - High-speed PCB design (DDR, PCIe, USB 3.0, MIPI)
  - Power management and USB-C PD integration
  - Linux bring-up (U-Boot, kernel config, device tree)
  - Modular design for multiple use cases (IoT, robotics, edge AI, prototyping)
